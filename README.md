Duke saves all tasks in the task list into a file called `data.txt` found in the `data` directory that can be found in the `duke` directory.

In the case that there is no such directory, a new directory and file will be created accordingly. However, if the file and directory already exist,
then all tasks in the task list will be loaded into the application upon startup. 

Do note that any changes made to the file externally will be reflected in the application upon startup.
