**About this Taskbot**

Jarvis is a Command Line Interface (CLI) task manager system that can be used to track various tasks. Jarvis aims to increase the productivity of its user. The tasks are saved in a local file that can be actively retrived (unless deleted) once Jarvis is activated. Jarvis has the ability to read time and dates so feel free to include due dates for your task. 

# Types of supported tasks
1.) ToDo 
2.) Deadline
3.) Event
