To execute the following commands, `list` out the list of tasks as shown in the [previous section](#list) and note the index of the task to operate on.

1. **Done Command**

To mark the task as `done`: `done` [_index of the task in the list_]

                      [T][✓] music homework

To `delete` the task: `delete` [_index of the task in the list_]

    Example of usage: delete 1
    Expected Outcome: Noted. I've removed this task:
                      [T][✓] music homework

## **Data Analysis** <a name="stats"></a>

<br>

### **Collection of Data** <a name="data"></a>

The list of all the tasks is located in the data directory and is named as `tasks.txt`.
The storage file is easy to read and edit.

Note that the file follows the following format:
 * Each variable is separated by  `|`.
 * The first letter represents the type of task.  
 
Letter | Task
---- | ----
T | todo
D | deadline
E | event

 * The second variable is the task description.
 * If exists, the third variable may be a timestamp depending on whether it is a `deadline` or `event` task. The timestamp will be in the format  [dd/MM/yyyy HHmm].
 * If the task has been completed, the last variable will be the timestamp of when it was marked as done.
