# atharvjoshi's Duke

**What**

* Duke was built as part of a module on Software Engineering I read at the National University of Singapore as part of my minor in Computer Science. 
* Duke is a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) application written in JAVA, following the OOP paradigm, and supplied with a basic GUI.
* Duke can manage a list of tasks such as to-dos, events, and deadlines with nine recognised commands tabulated below. Simply enter the command in the specified format and let Duke do the rest!

**Getting Duke**

Simply download the v0.3 jar release to get started. It is available here: https://github.com/atharvjoshi/duke/releases/tag/A-Release

# Acknowledgements
The project was built on code supplied by the CS2103 Teaching Department. Some parts of the code were reused from the JavaFX tutorials written by the CS2103 Teaching Department. The inspiration for the `undo` functionality came from a description of the OOP Command pattern by Matt Berther.
