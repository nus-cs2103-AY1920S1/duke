Duke - Your Personal Assistant Chat Bot!
=========================================
Built for the CS2103T individual project, this chatbot features capabilities for users to **store tasks** and **reminders for events and deadlines** for tracking. As this chatbot is capable of **full operation just using the keyboard**, this chat bot is highly suited for users who prefer typing as well.

This chatbot is a fork from the [original CLI chatbot](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/duke) from the CS2103T module repository.
