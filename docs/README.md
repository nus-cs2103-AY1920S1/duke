# User Guide
## 1. Introduction
Geoffrey is the freshest task manager on the block. This simple chat-bot is inspired by the American 90's show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

As Will Smith, you are able to tell your butler Geoffrey your task list which includes general to-do's, deadlines, and events. Not only can Geoffrey remember these tasks, he can mark them as done, delete them, and sort them based on your commands.
