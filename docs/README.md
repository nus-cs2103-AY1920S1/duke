# User Guide

## About Duke
Duke is an interactive chatbot that serves as a personal task list.


## Features

### Add / Delete a task
In Duke, you can add or delete tasks belonging to one of the three predefined categories - Todo, Event, Deadline.
For example, if you want to take note of an assignment deadline, you may add a deadline task to the task list.
You may also remove that deadline task afterwards if it is no longer of concern.

### Mark a task as done
In Duke, every task is set to be not done by default, and a cross symbol [✗] will be reflected on the task list. Once a task is cleared by you, you may mark it as done, and a tick symbol [✓] will be reflected instead.

### Display task list
View all the tasks in your task list. Each task will have a representative symbol to represent its status - done or not done.

### Auto-save functionality
In Duke, all tasks are automatically saved. No manual saving is needed.
