# User Guide

## Features 

### Adding Tasks
Allows users to add three different types of tasks to the tasklist including tasks of Todo, Deadline and Event type.
* Todo: Task that have no date required to be associated with it.
* Deadline: Task with a deadline associated with it (may either be a date or both date and time)
* Event: Task that has a date, start time and end time associated with it.
All tasks have an attribute that allows users to view and modify whether it has been completed.

### Listing Tasks
Allows users to list all tasks that have been added to the tasklist. Always shows tasks in order of chronology (date added) until they have been sorted in order of other fields by the user. All tasks in the list are automatically saved into a 'data' folder in the same directory where the Duke program is opened. (this folder will be created if it does not exist.)

### Loading Saved Tasks
A newly opened session of the Duke program will load tasks that have been saved in the 'data' folder specified under the 'Listing Tasks' feature described above.

### Restoration of Deleted Data
If the data file or folder containing the data file has been deleted halfway through the execution of the program, the program automatically restores the file open the next operation executed (and performs that operation).

### Marking Tasks to be Done / Undone
Allows users to mark a tasks or groups of tasks to be completed, or yet to be completed.

### Deleting Tasks
Allows users to delete tasks from the tasklist 

### Finding Tasks using Keywords
Allows users to find tasks using keywords (including type of task, task description, date / time and state of whether task is done / undone)

### Sorting Tasks
Allows users to sort tasks by alphabetical order of task type, done state, alphabetical order of task description and chronological order of date / time.

### Undo and Redo Features
Allows users to revert a list back to a newer or older state. The number of versions to be reverted may be specified by the user. The version of tasklist that has been reverted to will automatically be saved into the tasklist. All versions of tasklists in the session will exist until the user clears the program's cache or until the program exits.

### Clearing of Cache
Allows users to clear the timeline containing the list of tasks, deleting all versions of tasks stored in the timeline, except for the current active version of the tasklist.

### Generation of Random Tasks
Allows users to randomly generate a list of tasks for demonstration, examples and testing purposes.

### Showing of Help
Users may view the description and usage of any command or group of commands, or view the full list of commands by simply keying in "help".

### Display of Software and Developer Information
Users may view information about the developer and software by keying in "about". Credits to users for external sources of photos labeled to be free for use are also displayed here.

### Data Validation

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

```

### `bye` - Instructs the program to exit.

Program displays a goodbye message and waits for 0.9 seconds (for user to read the message) before closing.

Requires input to be in the format `bye`.

Example of usage: 

`bye`

Expected outcome:

`Bye. Hope to see you again soon!`

### `clearcache` - allows user to clear all stored versions of the tasklist except for the current active version.

Removes all versions of task lists in the timeline used for undo and redo operations, except for the current version. Since this operation cannot be under, after the user's command, the program will prompt for user to confirm by keying in 'CoNfiRMtOclEaR' before proceeding. This operation may be useful if the size of the timeline happens to get too large and slows down other operational procedures. The key will not be recognised on it's own without first  entering 'clearcache'. The process is aborted if input right after 'clearcache' does not match the required key and the user will have to enter 'clearcache' again if he/ she intends to re-initiate the process.

Requires input to be in the format `clearcache`.

Example of usage: 

`clearcache`

Expected outcome:

```
WARNING: THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE. Once executed, all versions other than the current version of the tasklist will be deleted and the undo / redo command will no longer be able to retrieve them even within this same session.

To confirm clearing of cache, type "CoNfiRMtOclEaR" with the same lettering cases. Otherwise, input any other character or string of text to cancel this operation.
```

`CoNfiRMtOclEaR`

Expected outcome:
`All versions of task lists in the undo / redo timeline except for the current task has been removed as requested.`
