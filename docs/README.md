# User Guide

## Introduction
Duke is an offline application for managing various tasks. It is optimised for those 
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Features 

### Command Format
* `DES` is short for description

* Words in `UPPER CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
e.g. in `todo TASK DES`, `TASK DES` is the parameter,
which can be used as `todo borrow book`

* In the examples, words in the diamond brackets (<>) are user inputs, and Duke 
responses are have a '__________' preceding and succeeding it. 

* The format for `DATE TIME` is
      
        dd/mm/yyyy <time in 24hr format>


### Add a task
Duke can track three types of tasks:
* *Todos*: tasks without any date/time attached to it
* *Deadlines*: tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time
* *Events*: tasks that start at a specific time

    | Task Type | Command |
    | --------- | ------- |
    | Todo | `todo TASK DES` |
    | Deadline | `deadline TASK DES /by DATE TIME` |
    | Event | `event TASK DES /at DATE TIME to DATE TIME` |

Examples:
    
    <todo borrow book>
