## Commands
Tasks have `event`,`deadline`,`todo` types. 
Each task contains description, time(only for `deadline` and `event`) and 
people.

Each person consists of name, title/relationship and contact number. 
A person can be represented by `name(title)123456`. 
If title or contact number are unknown, they can be omitted. 
Thus, these commands are also applicable: `James`,`James(boss)`,`James()123`. 

When creating `event` and `deadline` tasks, time is necessary for your new task. 
Your time can be a random string such as `tomorrow morning`. 
But if you want STM to understand your time as day, month, year, time; 
Your time should be in this format `day/month/year time`. 
For example, these are valid time `tonight`,`Wednesday afternoon`,`18/09/2019 1800`,`2/12/2020 6pm`.
