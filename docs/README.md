# User Guide

## Features 

Duke Skywalker is an experienced task manager (not the Windows one) who uses the force to create, modify, delete, and search through different kinds of Tasks. Duke Skywalker emulates a CLI, though it has a GUI.

### Create Tasks

`ToDo`: only has description
`Deadline`: has description, date and time
`Event`: has description, date, startTime and endTime

### Mark Task As Done
User can mark a task as done using its 1-index number.

### Delete a Task
User can delete a single task using its 1-index number.

### Delete All Done Tasks
User can delete all the tasks marked as done in the list.

### List All Tasks
User can list all tasks currently available in the list.
