## Features 

### Add and Delete Tasks 
You can add and delete different types of tasks to the chatbot task manager.
Currently, there are four types of tasks supported by Duke. These are the tasks you can input into the chatbot, to track your schedule.

* **Todo**:
The Todo task is a task with no date / time attached to it. 
(Eg. Visit a new theme park)

* **Deadline**:
The Deadline task is a task that needs to be done before a specific date / time.
(Eg. Submit project report by 11/09/2019 1200)

* **Event**:
The Event task is a task that starts at a specific time and ends at a specific time. 
(Eg. Team project meeting at 11/09/2019 1200-1400)

* **Fixed Duration Task**:
The Fixed Duration Task is an unscheduled task that takes a fixed amount of time.  
(Eg. Reading the sales report needs 2 hours)
