# User Guide

This user guide contains instructions on how to enter commands to Duke. Duke provides both Command Line Interface (CLI) as well as Graphic User Interface (GUI). Command keywords and format are the same for both interfaces and introduced below.

>*Note: The current version of Duke only supports GUI input/output.*

## Features 

### Add and keep track of tasks 
Store different types of tasks (todo, event, deadline) and track its status.

### Saves tasks locally
Changes to tasks are saved locally. The same task list from your current session will be loaded the next time you open Duke.

### Mark task as done
Tasks are marked as undone when created by default. You can mark them as done whenever you wish.

### List all tasks
All existing tasks will be listed in order of creation, showing their index, completion status and description.

### Delete tasks
Tasks can be deleted.

### Search for specific tasks
Search for task by entering keyword in the task description.

### Snooze task
Change the time associated with a task.

## Startup

Upon launching application, the program should print a welcome message in CLI and GUI. This should be followed by a message regarding local disk saving status (in CLI only):

- if save file is found loaded without error:
```
>>Save file loaded successfully
```
- if save file doesn't exist and new file is safely created:
```
>>New save file created
```
- if there is error loading or finding save file (depending on error):
```
>>Directory search error. No save file loaded. Initialized with blank list. No commands will be saved to hard disk
```
```
>>Bad datetime in saved file. List may be partially loaded. Editing not recommended
```
```
>>Corrupted save file. Delete or edit then relaunch
```
