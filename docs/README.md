## 3. Features
Queen_BB can store 3 types of tasks namely `todo`, `deadline`, `event`. The following are the key differences:
* `todo`: Tasks which do not have a fixed date by when they need to be accomplished.
* `deadline`: Tasks which need to be completed by a certain date and time.
* `event`: Tasks which are planned for a certain date and time.

### Task Creation 
Queen_BB allows you to create a new task by simply using the `todo`, `deadline` or `event` commands. Every new task
 is marked as not done by default.
 
It will confirm the creation of a new task. If a task already exists, then a message regarding the same will be
 displayed.
 

### Task Completion
A task can be marked as done using the `done` command. 

### Task Deletion
A task can be deleted using the `delete` command.

### Display All Tasks
All the tasks can be easily seen using the `list` command.

### Finding a task
A task can be found by searching for the related keyword using the `find` command.

### Save All Tasks Locally
All the tasks in the list will be automatically saved in a .txt file.

### Load All Locally Saved Tasks  
All the tasks saved in the local .txt file will be loaded on launch.

### Bye
Queen_BB bids farewell.
