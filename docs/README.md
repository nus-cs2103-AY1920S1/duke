## Features

### Manage different types of tasks
In Duke, there are 4 types of tasks:

1. Todo
 - A todo is something you want to do.

1. Deadline
 - A deadline is a task that you need to do before a certain time.

1. Event
 - An event is a task has an event date, so you can remember to attend it.

1. After
 - An After is a task that only needs to be attended to after a certain date. So take a break in the mean time. Take a kitkat!


Each task can be added, marked as done, or removed when you do not need it anymore.

### Better Search
---

You can narrow down the task you're looking for using keywords.

### Friendlier Syntax
---

Ramp up your experience with custom command aliases.
Once you are familiar with the basics, you can assign custom aliases to duke commands to speed up your workflow.
