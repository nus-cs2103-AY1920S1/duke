# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Getting Organised (User Guide)

## Features 

### Add Todo, Deadline or Event 
For the experienced overcommitter, it can be a struggle to keep track of all that you're doing. With Duke, you get 3 
ways to keep track of your various commitments.

`todo <taskName>` - Add a standard task

`deadline <taskName> \by <due date in format DD/mm/yyyy HHmm` - Add a deadline task with a due date

`event <taskName> \at <event date-time in format DD/mm/yyyy HHmm` - Add a deadline task with a due date

### Find Tasks
Too much to do to look through your whole list? Just search for your task with relevant keywords. Never feel lost again.

`find <keyword>` - Returns all tasks with descriptions containing the keyword

### List 'em all!
Lists all tasks

`list` - Returns all tasks from the beginning of time

### Mark as Done, Delete
Done with your tasks, or too tired of trying to finish them? Clear them out and never think about them again!

`done <task number>` - Mark task as done, following the index of the task
`delete <task number` - Completely removes the task from the list, never to be seen or thought about again (the latter 
is not guaranteed)

### Re-organise Tasks
Too much to do and too lazy to prioritise it? Let Duke do it for you with our sorting feature!

`sort <sortBy - dateTime/completed>` - Sort list temporarily according to the sortBy keyword used - sort from earliest
to latest (datetime) or sort to shove the completed ones below (completed)
