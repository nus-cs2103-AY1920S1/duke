### GUI
Instead of giving commands via a simple CLI, all inputs and outputs are displayed on a GUI designed for a quality and smooth User Experience.

### Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
Duke is able to effectively perform CRUD actions based on pre-defined User Commands.

### Saving and Loading
User-Created entities are saved into a text file and loaded everytime Duke starts up. 

### Task List
Duke provides the functionality to save and record to-dos, events, and deadlines.

### Contact List
Duke provides the functionality to save the personal information of your contacts.
