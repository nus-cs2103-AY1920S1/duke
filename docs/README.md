# User Guide
## Introduction
This is a user guide for the Individual Project segment of the CS2103T module.
While lacking in serious functionality, this segment provides 
a strong base for the understanding of the addressbook code. 

The duke program is a task-tracker that allows its user to add 3 
types of tasks - To do tasks, Deadline task and Event tasks. The 
specifics of each task will be elaborated below. 

In addition, the user can view all the tasks, mark the status of each task,
delete each task, find a keyword, tag a task and find a tag. 
The specifics of each feature will be elaborated
