## 1. Introduction

SerSnapsalot(SS) is for those of us who enjoy keeping track of tasks through a desktop. Specifically, SS is designed to
implement a CLI while utilizing a Graphical User Interface (GUI). SS also takes reference from Marvel's Spiderman and Ironman
to keep a light and refreshing atmosphere.
