# Duke - User Guide
Duke is a personal assistant chatbot that helps you keep track of various tasks, which are saved as `ToDo`s, 
`Deadline`s, and `Event`s.  
Duke makes use of local storage so that previously entered tasks will be remembered even after the application closes.

## <a name="features"></a>Features 
### 1. Keep track of various types of tasks
Duke manages and helps you keep track of your tasks which can be either [ToDos](#todo), [Deadlines](#deadline), or 
[Events](#event).  
Each task will contain a text description. In addition, [Deadlines](#deadline) and [Events](#event) will also contain
a date and time, which is the deadline and the event timing respectively.  
All tasks can be added, marked as done or 
deleted using Duke's [commands](#commands).

<a name="todo"></a>`ToDo`  
Tasks that you have yet to complete but do not have a time restriction on. (e.g. books you want to read).

<a name="deadline"></a>`Deadline`  
Tasks that you have yet to complete but must do so within a certain date and time (e.g. submission of assignments).  

<a name="event"></a>`Event`  
Tasks that you have to be available for during a certain date and time (e.g. driving test, project meetings).  

### 2. Avoid clashes in events
When you add a new event to Duke, Duke will help you check through all your previously entered events to ensure that 
there is no clash in timing with the newly added event. In the event that there is a clash, Duke will prompt you with
the existing event that clashes with the new event. Since you might have many commitments, Duke helps you ensure that you do not double book yourself to different 
commitments at the same time and save you the stress of having to choose in the last minute.

The command for this feature is [`event`](#event-usage).

### 3. Search through saved tasks
Duke allows you to search through your saved tasks by looking up matching texts with the keyword that you have entered.
This allows you to filter through your tasks of interests instead of having to scroll through the entire list just to
find what you are looking for.

The command for this feature is [`find`](#find-usage).

### 4. View all your tasks 
Duke allows you to view all the tasks that you have added previously before in a list containing all necessary details, 
such as the type of task, the description, and the date and time (if applicable). The clean organisation of information
is pleasing to read and easy to understand.

The command for this feature is [`list`](#list-usage).

### 5. Saves tasks on local storage
Duke stores all entered tasks onto local storage so that these tasks will not disappear even after you close the 
chatbot and return at a later time. This also means you do not need to keep Duke running to save your tasks.
