# Duke User Guide
Duke is an interactive chat-box style task manager which allows you to conveniently create and manage day
to day tasks primarily to-dos, events and deadlines in a simple and user-friendly environment.  

## Features 

### Task Creation
Duke allows you to easily create different tasks such as to-dos, events and deadlines which are then
stored on the system.

### Task Management
When certain tasks have been completed, Duke allows you to mark them as done thereby
allowing you to keep better track of your pending items.

### Task Deletion
Duke allows you to delete redundant tasks so you see only what you want to see.

In case you have a long list of tasks, Duke will allow you to search tasks you are looking for
based on a particular keyword or even just parts of words.
