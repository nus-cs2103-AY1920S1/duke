# User Guide
Text-based personal assistant with CLI input.

![Duke UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielchao/duke/master/docs/Ui.png)

## Features 

Duke is a text-based personal assistant that helps you keep track of tasks. Supported task types include:
1. Todos
2. Deadlines
3. Events

Duke provides commands to manage your tasks. You can:
* List tasks
* Find tasks by keyword
* Add tasks
* Mark tasks as done
* Delete tasks
* Undo the last change

Duke uses a GUI to display output in a more intuitive way than purely CLI-based programs, while its CLI-based input allows power users to work faster with Duke than with purely GUI-based personal assistants.

## Usage
