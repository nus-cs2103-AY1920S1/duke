# User Guide

## Features 

**Duke** is a personal chat-bot assistant. So what can he do?

#### Remember your tasks
Duke is able to remember the different tasks you have input. These include tasks that you
have todo, or tasks with a deadline or a timing. He is able to list out all the tasks
you have available.

#### Finish a Task
Duke has the ability to track which tasks are finished or not. Simply tell him to
mark it as finished and he will remember that.

#### Delete a Task
If you are finished with a task and don't need to look at it anymore, Duke is able to
delete the task from his memory. Just give the command!

#### Find a Task
Sometimes your list of tasks just gets too large. Duke is able to find any task from
his memory. Just give him a search term and he will find it for you.
