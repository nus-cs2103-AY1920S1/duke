								key dates for all your important events. These tasks that you have can be classified
								into To Do,
								Events and Deadline tasks. Users can then give timings for their deadline tasks, when
								they need
								to complete it by. As for event tasks, they can give a time where the event will occur.

								alters the task list.
								This helps to ensure that the task list will be the most updated one even when Duke is
								to crash.
